# Citibike_Analysis

## Overview

We were so enthralled by the Citibike service in New York City that we prepose that a similar service be started in Des Moines, Iowa. Below is part of our pitch to investors to present the benefits and untapped market opportunities this service holds by analysing rides with Citibike from August of 2019.

### General Overview
  - This month alone saw over 2.3 million rides. Most (about 2 million) are from users who subscribe to the Citibike Service. This begins to show the immense popularity of Citibike among the residents of NYC. And, as you can see, people use Citibike throughout the day and even into the night.
  - You'll see in the highlighted portion that (judging by ride start time) its even possible that the residents use Citibike as a means to commute to and from their jobs in addition to recreation

### Rides by Age
  - And it's not just young people that love Citibike (though they seem to be a popular demographic). Men and women of all ages love it. But why does it seem that men overall seem to be the primary demographic?

### Ride Breakdown by Time of Day and Gender
  - This gives you a better idea of how the bikes are used. It's clear with this breakdown that there is a vast difference in usage over the weekend vs during the week.
  - You see here that usage during business days/times is much more centered towards male demographics during commuting hours, indicating that men are perhaps mainly using Citibike to commute to/from the office. However, usage does not drop much over the weekend. While usage begins much later as people sleep in, it's far more spread throughout the day indicating that people are using them to get around and have fun on their days off. The slight increase in usage from non-subscribers (i.e. probably "non-residents") over the weekend points to this trend as well.

### Length of Rides
  - Not only do people use Citibike in many day-to-day situations, they use the bikes themselves for longer than you might think.
  - There are very few people that rent-out the bikes for less than an hour. In fact, the bulk of people rent bikes for aroud 5 hours with the bulk of customers renting them out longer than that. Depending on how you charge for rides there is a massive opportunity here. 
  - It's possible that Citibike might offer a certain number of rental hours at a time before upcharging, which would explain the large number of subscribers at the 5 hour mark. Non-subscribers, though a much smaller demographics for Citibike, don't seem to care as much about the length of their travel as their numbers are pretty consistant across the length of rides. Perhaps they are given a day-rate for a bike ride. Either way, the fact that such a large number of people are using the bikes for such a long period of time is a very promising prospect.
